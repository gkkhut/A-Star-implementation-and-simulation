MATLAB program is included in the code folder. 
The program generates the an optimum path from start point to end points
avoiding obstacles using A* Algorithm for differential drive vehicle.

Steps to run the program:
Extract the files to a folder
1) Open MATLAB and open [astar_diff.m] file which is in the Code folder.
2) Make sure all the files are in the code directory.
3) Change the working directory to Code folder.
4) Run the main program.
5) Select the goal point.
6) The optimum path will be generated using A8 algorithm once the execution is completed(reached the goal point).
7) Details regarding the nodes and nodeinfo are available at the variable workspace - nodes and nodesinfo.
